<div class="wikidoc"><b>Project Description</b><br />A .NET 3.5 library written in C&#35; which allows the conversion of LaTeX documents to XHTML&#43;MathML format. A stand-alone converter is included. The license is GPL v3.<br />One may know about <a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht">Tex4ht</a>. I find it very slow and buggy (100% of 5 very simple converted LaTeX articles just are invalid XML files which can not be shown in any browser). You may also try <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/miaou/tralics">TRALICS</a>. It is also ridiculous - consider CSS for example.<br /><br /><b>Under development</b><br />The project currently is in the alpha stage.<br /><br />To view MathML formulas, you need a browser compatible with <a href="http://w3c.org">W3C</a> <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math">MathML 2.0</a> standard. Such browsers are
<ul><li>Internet Explorer with <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathplayer/default.htm">Design Science MathPlayer</a> plugin</li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox &gt;= 1.5</li>
<li>Opera with <a href="http://xml-maiden.com/userjs/mathml">UserJS MathML</a> plugin.</li></ul>
At the moment, the library was tested on Firefox 3.6 and IE.<br />Only valid latex documents are supported (that is, understood by latex.exe). Besides, fences must match (the equal number of &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; in the document).<br /><br /><b>Features</b><br />Latex2MathML consists of the LaTeX parser which builds the document object tree (DOT) and the converter which makes XML from that tree.<br />The library uses <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net">Apache log4net</a> for logging purposes.<br />The library uses <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper">JetBrains Resharper</a> to maintain the code quality.<br />Latex2MathML validates each result against XHTML 1.1 + MathML 2.0 DTD.<br />A nice table of contents is written if any section structure has been found. The same is with BibTeX (in development builds).<br /><br /><b>Unlike many educational projects on .edu domains, Latex2MathML is developed by a professional programmer.</b><br /><br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
