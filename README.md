# Latex2MathML

A .NET library written in C# which allows the conversion of LaTeX documents to HTML+MathML format. A stand-alone converter is included.

This project is derived from [Latex2MathML on CodePlex](https://latex2mathml.codeplex.com) that targets .NET framework 3.5. I create this version simply because I think one day I will need it, and there is no roadmap so far. Currently it can be compiled with .NET 5 using Visual Studio 2022 Preview.

Feel free to submit an issue if you have ideas and suggestions.
